Code:

main:
    mov $XXXXXXX, %eax
    mov $0, %ebx
    mov $0x5, %ecx
loop:
    test %eax, %eax
    jz fin
    add %ecx, %ebx
    dec %eax
    jmp loop
fin:
    cmp $0x8f2f, %ebx
    je good
    mov $0, %eax
    jmp end
good:
    mov $1, %eax
end:
    ret

The challenge says we should figure out what sould be there in the $XX to make main return the value 0x1. To accomplish that we have to enter in the function good() and to do that, the cmp $0x8f2f, %ebx needs to return true so we take the je good jump. 0x8f2f is a hexdecimal which is 36655 in decimal. We can see from the loop function that %ecx adds to the value of %ebx every loop and the value of %ecx is given from the main function, which is 0x5. So %ebx is being incremented by 0x5 everytime. Divinding 36655 by 5 we get 7331, which is 0x1CA3 in hexdecimal.
