Looking at the note.txt we can guess its from Germany and looking at the picture given, we can assure its a Enigma Machine from WW2. Using the Enigma simulator from this site http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/enigma.html we put the values from the note.txt on the right fields and we get the message

QUIT EPUZ ZLIN GIND EED

Seems wrong at first, but putting altogether we get QUITEPUZZLINGINDEED
